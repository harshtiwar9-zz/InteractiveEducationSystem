        Experience with interactive learning systems has become an important aspect of both formal and informal curriculum activity. This paper starts by discussing the underlying mechanisms upon which these systems are based. A description is then given of some general design models and guidelines for their production, before the paper goes on to look at some of the currently available production tools and fabrication technologies. Finally, some case studies are presented and potential future directions of development are outlined.
